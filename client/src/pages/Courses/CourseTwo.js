          This course will provide an introduction to the finite element methods
          and their applications to the scalar convection diffusion equations
          and to the Navier-Stokes equations. The course will cover the basic
          mathematical theory of the finite element methods, and the development
          of fully practical finite element algorithms for solving partial
          differential equations elliptic and parabolic scalar PDES, linear
          elasticity, Mindlin-Reissner plate problem, Navier-Stokes equations.
          Further, the lab component will consists of programming assignments
          including the implementation of the finite element algorithms, solving
          scalar and Navier-Stokes equations using the in-house package ParMooN.

          There will be three assignments and most of the assignment problems
          require computer programming. Matlab/Fortran/C/C++ can be used. Late
          submission (beyond the deadline) of assignment will result in zero
          credit.
          <br />
          <span className="weight">Midterm/Final Exam: </span>
          Both midterm and final written exams will examine the understanding of
          the finite element theory and algorithms. Students will NOT be allowed
          to carry any text materials for both midterm and final exams.
