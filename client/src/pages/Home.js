        Computational Mathematics Group (CMG) at the Department of Computational
        and Data Sciences is under the Division of Interdisciplinary Research at
        Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, India.
        <br />
        We develops accurate, efficient and robust parallel numerical (finite
        element) schemes for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that
        model several physical and industrial processes. <br />
        Please visit our in-house finite element package ParMooN.
